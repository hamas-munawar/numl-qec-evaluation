# 🎓 NUML QEC Evaluation v1.0

An aesthetic, easy-to-use browser tool created specifically for students at the **National University of Modern Languages (NUML)**. This helper automates the Quality Evaluation Cell (QEC) forms, saving you time while providing professional, randomized feedback.

## ✨ Features: What it does for you

This extension simplifies your evaluation process with four dedicated features:

1.  **Fill Teacher Evaluation**: Automatically selects the "Excellent" rating for all questions and writes unique feedback comments in the teacher form for your review.
2.  **Fill & Submit Teacher Evaluation**: Identifies the teacher form, fills everything out instantly, and clicks the "Save" button for you.
3.  **Fill Course Evaluation**: Fills out the student-level course criteria with high ratings and randomizes your feedback comments.
4.  **Fill & Submit Course Evaluation**: Handles the entire course evaluation process from filling to final submission with a single click.

### Why use it?

- **Auto form Filling**: With just a click you can fill whole form.
- **Randomized Feedback**: It doesn't just copy the same text; it picks different professional comments from a pool so your evaluations look natural.
- **Friendly Progress Tracker**: The app shows you exactly what it's doing (e.g., "Applying ratings," "Writing feedback") so you know when it's done.
- **Modern Interface**: Designed with a clean, light aesthetic that is easy to navigate.
